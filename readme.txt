This was a quick script I made for my own personal convenience. Youtube used to offer a feature that allowed you to pop videos out of the page. Unfortunately they seem to have removed that feature. I created this script as a quick fix to allow videos to be popped out of the page.

To utilize this script

1. Install Taper Monkey on Chrome or Grease Monkey on Firefox
2. Add this script to the extension
3. Open up a page on Youtube. The "Pop-Out" button should appear on the page.
4. Click the button and enjoy popped out videos!

Note: This button will often appear on embedded videos. I have not added further functionality for it to work under these circumstances. It only works on the main page of videos!
